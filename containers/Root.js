      description: `Principal front end developer for the 2017 Beauty and the Beast Homeaway Landing Page. I was tasked with creating this Landing Page in a short amount of time from scratch. I worked closely and successfully coordinated with several teams including UX, marketing, analytics, and dev-ops. This was a very expensive and prominent campaign that turned out very well and went above and beyond the client's expectations. Tech stake included: Grunt, Handlbars, Require.js, jQuery, Less, NPM, Wistia.`,

      title: '7 Election',
      description: 'Principal front end developer for the 2016 7 Election website. A partnership with The Onion all but guaranteed a large userbase. I created this site from scratch in the very tight deadline of 2.5 weeks. I was given mobile/desktop PSD comps and from that made a fully responsive site cross browser tested supporting back to IE10. All Javascript logic is written in ES6 (ECMA 2016) and completely modularized leveraging Browserify to bundle and transpile the code for the browser.  Heavy utilization of the following design patterns: Promises, Observer, Module. Other tech I used: stylus, gulp, jQuery 3.0, Google Map API (heavily customized), ES6 Promise Debounce, Babel, Browser Sync, Event Emitter 2, and Notie.',
